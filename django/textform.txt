1)Chat Folders is one of the best Telegram tricks 

2)that you should know and utilize to your maximum advantage. 

3)We follow so many channels and groups on Telegram of different kinds, not to mention the individual chats that go into the mix. 

4)Having all these chats in one panel makes things much harder to declutter and make sense of. 

5)So to solve this issue, Telegram has brought something called “Chat Folders”. 

6)This allows you to categorize your chats into different labels and Telegram sort things out for you.

7) As a result, Telegram gets super clean and much easier to manage. I love it!
